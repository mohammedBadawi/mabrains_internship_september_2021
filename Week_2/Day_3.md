# Day 3
I have learned the basics of bash shell scripting from [**the learnshell.org interactive Shell Programming tutorial**](https://www.learnshell.org/):
The basics section covered the following topics:
  * Hello, World!
  * Variables
  * Passing Arguments to the Script
  * Arrays
  * Basic Operators
  * Basic String Operations
  * Decision Making
  * Loops
  * Array-Comparison
  * Shell Functions
